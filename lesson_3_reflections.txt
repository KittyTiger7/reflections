Question:
	When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

			Backup, collaboration.


Question:
	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

			To have benefits of compartmentalization.


Question:
	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

			A fork is a clone on the github servers. A clone is when you make copy from distant repository to your own machine, or when you make copies locally on your own machine. A branch is when you try out a new direction/concept/whatever in your program, and you want it to not influence existing working code.
